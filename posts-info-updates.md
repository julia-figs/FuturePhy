<h2>Welcome to FuturePhy!</h2>
<p>I am really excited to announce our FuturePhy project and would like to invite you to join us. This project is a series of conferences, workshops and hackathons about the Tree of Life, sponsored by the National Science Foundation. The primary aim of this project is to bring the phylogenetics and broader biodiversity communities together to develop plans for what the future of phylogenetics might be if we are to successfully maximize the impact of the Tree of Life on data integration in the life sciences. What do you think are the most important questions in phylogenetics and biodiversity? How can we plan for taking advantage of the amazing success in phylogenetics research over the past decades, while also addressing the major challenges that still exist? What is the fundamental significance of a large-scale Tree of Life for the life sciences, for biodiversity, environmental health, conservation, agriculture, medicine, and policy decisions that impact these critical areas of inquiry? The FuturePhy project will hold a series of conferences and workshops to do some big picture brainswarming as well as some specific, targeted planning on such questions, and we aim to develop a much broader forum using virtual participation to gather ideas. We have an exciting start to this initiative, and a great team of people to help chart the course for the project, but we really need your input and ideas in order to succeed. Below I include our announcement, the various ways to participate in FuturePhy now, and some of the initial topics and questions that may be of interest as the project proceeds. Thank you for your interest in FuturePhy!</p>

<p><b>Announcement: FuturePhy Conferences and Workshops on Phylogenetics.</b></p>

<p>FuturePhy is an NSF-sponsored, three-year program of conferences, workshops and hackathons on the Tree of Life that aims to promote novel, integrative data analyses and visualization, interdisciplinary syntheses in phylogenetic sciences, and cross-cutting uses of phylogenetics to develop and address new research questions and applications. Specifically, FuturePhy seeks to catalyze the community and chart a path to resolve, calibrate, make accessible, and champion the use of a more comprehensive tree of life, which will be curated and managed long into the future with regular updates to connect to a broad range of biological, environmental and societal information as knowledge grows. The first phase of this mission is critical: to bring together a broad community of people from diverse backgrounds who are active in phylogenetics research, who use the tree of life in research or education, who benefit in applied or practical ways from a comprehensive tree of life, or who come from a background that offers new perspectives on defining, addressing or transcending key challenges in phylogenetics. Therefore, we are gathering ideas from the community to identify the most important themes to consider during these workshops. An initial list of possible topics is given below- we encourage refinements of this list and completely different ideas as well! Help accelerate progress in all aspects of phylogenetics research by joining FuturePhy today. Diverse opportunities will be available to attend FuturePhy sessions in person or virtually, and to link FuturePhy to existing projects and initiatives.</p>

<p>Conference and workshop ideas: draft list</p>
<ol>
<li>How to articulate and ‘publicize’ the value of phylogenetics to all communities (e.g., medicine, agriculture, art, engineering, other biological fields, conservation, law, climate change).</li>
<li>Assessment of knowledge and data available about the Tree of Life: gap analysis and data depth metrics.</li>
<li>Tools to streamline tree building: Open Tree/TreeBase integration, tree assembly and trees as data layers.</li>

<h2>About FuturePhy</h2>
<p>Completing the Tree of Life is a grand challenge in science, on the same intellectual scale as investigating the nature of matter or the origin of the universe: it is fundamental to understanding our world, central to human sustainability, and critical as a framework for enabling interdisciplinary discovery. Progress toward this challenge has begun to transform the life sciences by blending biology with computer science and successfully generating large genealogies of thousands -- even millions -- of species. These large trees are now informing many branches of biology, from genomics to ecology, and have great promise for applications in medicine, agriculture, industry, and climate-change mitigation.</p>

<p>It is critical that scientists develop a future vision for this area of scientific exploration, and we work together to clarify and visualize the central role of phylogenetics in the strategic integration of biodiversity science across US academic, corporate and government institutions. To achieve this vision, this project has developed a three-year program of catalysis meetings and workshops to bring together the Tree of Life community.</p>

<p>By uniting a wide range of biologists, computational experts, and representatives from corporate entities, foundations, and government agencies, the meeting series will address three primary goals: (1) identifying challenges and enabling progress in generating, storing and visualizing the genealogy of life, (2) identifying challenges and enabling progress in integrating large data layers with the tree of life, and (3) developing a clear plan and compelling vision for the future of phylogenetic biology.</p>

<p>Participants will include students and early-career scientists, innovators, educators, and members of key corporate, government and non-profit organizations. Tangible products will include publications that highlight new tools and uses relevant to the tree of life, advances in software that will be open source and available to a wide audience, educational materials, and specific recommendations for the maintenance of phylogenetic resources, biodiversity data, and addressing national challenges in biodiversity science and education.</p>

<u>FuturePhy Conference Series details</u>
<ul>
<li>Three large conferences over three years: meeting dates TBA</li>
<li>Three or more smaller workshops and/or hackathons aimed at solving specific problems or developing specific products associated with the initiative.</li>
<li>Participants will be invited from major NSF funded projects in this area, at-large members of the evolutionary biology community, and members of governmental units and corporate entities.</li>

<h2>Phenotype RCN 2016</h2>
<p>At the end of February, Mark Westneat and I attended the fifth Phenotype Research Coordination Network meeting at <a class="ext-link" href="http://biosphere2.org" rel="external">Biosphere 2</a> in beautiful Oracle, AZ on behalf of the FuturePhy project. The program included a mix of impactful talks, breakout sessions, and panels about our shared interest in data integration. As an <a class="ext-link" href="http://uberon.github.io/about.html" rel="external">ontology</a> and bioinformatics newbie, this was such an exciting, inviting, and successful opportunity to learn about cutting-edge phenotypic data integration tools and emerging technologies. Furthermore, it was also an excellent follow-up to the inaugural FuturePhy workshop that was held the weekend before in Gainesville, FL that focused on clade-based tree-data integration. Networks were formed, interdisciplinary collaborations ignited, and decisive plans to tackle the huge undertaking of making phenotypic data more useable and sustainable by the biodiversity and phylogenetics communities at large were sparked. Although this was the final Phenotype RCN meeting, I look forward to seeing (and being involved with) how these objectives are fleshed out in the years to come. <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.phenotypercn.org/?page_id=2750" rel="external">You can click here to learn more about the 2016 Phenotype RCN</a>.</p>
